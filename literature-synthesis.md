# Literature Synthesis

Sleep health is increasingly recognized as a population health construct with relevance to mental health outcomes [@buysse2014sleephealth]. Across observational studies, sleep duration often exhibits a non-linear association with depression, with both short and long sleep durations associated with higher risk of depressive symptoms compared with mid-range sleep durations. A prospective meta-analysis of adult cohorts reported elevated risk for incident depression among both short and long sleepers relative to normal sleep duration [@zhai2015sleepdepression].

NHANES provides nationally representative U.S. estimates and includes validated depression screening via the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) [@kroenke2001phq9]. Recent NHANES-based work has also examined sleep dimensions jointly (e.g., sleep duration and trouble sleeping) in relation to depressive symptoms [@wang2024nhanesSleepDepression].

Motivated by this literature, the current analysis evaluates the association between weekday/workday sleep duration and clinically relevant depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 >= 10) in NHANES 2017-2018, using survey-weighted models to account for the complex sampling design and adjusting for key sociodemographic and behavioral covariates.
